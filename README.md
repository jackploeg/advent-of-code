# Advent Of Code

From: https://github.com/peckb1/advent-of-code/tree/main/src/main/kotlin/me/peckb/aoc

It's time to explore the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com).

The solutions are written with the following goals:

1. **Readibility** 
   The code should be immediately understandable, even to those without knowledge of the language used.
2. **Clean Abstractions**.
   The code should not have any extraneous copy/paste. 
   Everything should fall under the single responsibility principle.
   
   
## Running

The problems are run as unit tests, with their result matching the correct answer
as the value which passed the given day/phase combination

To Generate files for a new daily puzzle run application and enter the year and day.

To generate the DaggerTestDayComponent classes: run kaptTestKotlin.
